Introduction
------------
This openFrameworks addon mantains complex UI hierarchies within the oF app asynchronously. Every object has its own draw/update/input functions, and you can add or change them in any place within app at runtime. It relies heavily on C++11 syntax and requires oF 0.9.0.

Warning! Still in development. Expect API changes.

## Features
* Hierarchies of any complexity, managable in a simplest way possible
* Your widgets and views are animatable with custom easing functions, the default one is also provided
* You can use animation engine to animate your own properties of practically any kind effectively
* All the app input is streamlined in order to support multiple platforms, be it a touch-enabled device or a computer with mouse and keyboard. It'll use as little platform code as possible.
* Optional constraint solver enables you to easily manage flexible UI layouts
* Event system provides an efficient way to program complex widget behaviours
* You can use Gesture Recognizers to decode and use basic input patterns (like dragging or pinching) easily

More documentation (and examples) is coming soon.
