Introduction
------------
This openFrameworks addon mantains complex UI hierarchies within the oF app. Every object has its own draw/update/input functions stack, and you can add or change them in any place within app at runtime. 



## Features
* Hierarchies of any complexity, managable in a simplest way possible
* All the app input is streamlined in order to support multiple platforms, be it a touch-enabled device or a computer with mouse and keyboard. It uses as little platform code as possible.
* Optional constraint solver enables you to easily manage flexible UI layouts
* Event system provides an efficient way to program complex widget behaviours
* You can use Gesture Recognizers to decode and use basic input patterns (like dragging or pinching) easily

More documentation (and examples) is coming soon.
